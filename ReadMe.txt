SplitsHappen
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program contains a namespace that allows for the calculation of various 
bowling scores. A string is parsed and the given bowling score is then
returned.

There is also a helper namespace splitshappentester, which will run through
various examples strings and check them for correctness.

This project can be compiled using the included Makefile, which will create
an output file that can be executed.
